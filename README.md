A brief introduction of numpy and pandas basic in python data analysis

# Introduction to Pandas and NumPy
pandas and NumPy are very useful libraries in Python. Let's learn how to use them!

# Pandas
Pandas is a very popular library for working with data (its goal is to be the most powerful and flexible open-source tool, and in our opinion, it has reached that goal). DataFrames are at the center of pandas. A DataFrame is structured like a table or spreadsheet. The rows and the columns both have indexes, and you can perform operations on rows or columns separately.

A pandas DataFrame can be easily changed and manipulated. Pandas has helpful functions for handling missing data, performing operations on columns and rows, and transforming data. If that wasnâ€™t enough, a lot of SQL functions have counterparts in pandas, such as join, merge, filter by, and group by. With all of these powerful tools, it should come as no surprise that pandas is very popular among data scientists.

# Numpy
NumPy is an open-source Python library that facilitates efficient numerical operations on large quantities of data. There are a few functions that exist in NumPy that we use on pandas DataFrames. For us, the most important part about NumPy is that pandas is built on top of it. So, NumPy is a dependency of Pandas.
